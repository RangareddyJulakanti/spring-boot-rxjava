= RxJava Demo App

This app retrieves github user information (user info, followers and repositories).

The main goal is to illustrate how to use rjxava and how to parallelize tasks.

The app is still a work in progress and is not completely "reactive".

== Stack

- spring-boot 1.2.6
- java 8
- rxjava

== Example

- `mvn test spring-boot:run`
- `curl http://localhost:8080/github/users/ojacquemart`

In the logs, you will notice that the 3 http requests are launched at the exact same time.
